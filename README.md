# Moom MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables programmatic control of [Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) window layouts on macOS through natural language commands in Claude Desktop.

## Overview

This MCP server allows Claude to interact with Moom, a powerful macOS window management tool, enabling you to:
- Switch between saved window layouts
- Create new window arrangements with pixel-perfect precision
- Control window positioning and sizing across multiple monitors
- Manage your workspace layouts through conversational commands
- **NEW**: DisplayPlacer integration for exact multi-monitor positioning

## Features

- üñºÔ∏è **activate_layout** - Instantly switch to any saved Moom layout
- üíæ **save_current_layout** - Save your current window arrangement as a reusable layout
- üéØ **trigger_moom_action** - Execute Moom window actions (resize, move, center, etc.)
- üìã **show_moom_menu** - Display the Moom popup menu
- üñ•Ô∏è **DisplayPlacer Integration** - Pixel-perfect multi-monitor window positioning
- üìê **Precision Layouts** - Exact coordinate-based window management
- üíº **Professional Workflow Management** - Predefined, clean screen setups using `ProfessionalWorkflowManager`.
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** - Tools for listing and activating workflows locally.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use natural language commands in Claude Desktop:
### Activating Layouts
- "Switch to my Teaching (Mac Mini) layout"
- "Activate the AI Research Mode workspace"
- "Use my coding layout"
- **NEW**: "Switch to DisplayPlacer Coding Pro" (pixel-perfect positioning)

### Saving Layouts
- "Save the current window arrangement as 'Focus Mode'"
- "Create a new layout called 'Video Editing'"

### Window Actions
- "Make this window bigger" (grow)
- "Center the active window"
- "Move window to the left"
- "Fill the screen with current window"

### Menu Access
- "Show the Moom menu"
- "Open Moom's layout picker"

### Multi-Monitor Precision (NEW)
- "Create a DisplayPlacer coding layout" (uses exact coordinates)
- "Position windows with pixel precision"
- "Optimize for my 4K display setup"

## Available Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `activate_layout` | Switch to a saved Moom layout | `{ "layoutName": "Teaching (Mac Mini)" }` |
| `save_current_layout` | Save current window arrangement | `{ "layoutName": "Development Setup" }` |
| `trigger_moom_action` | Execute window actions | `{ "action": "center" }` |
| `show_moom_menu` | Display Moom popup menu | `{}` |

### Supported Window Actions

- `grow` - Increase window size
- `shrink` - Decrease window size
- `move-left` - Move window left
- `move-right` - Move window right
- `move-up` - Move window up
- `move-down` - Move window down

### Installation (Optional)
```bash
brew install jakehilborn/jakehilborn/displayplacer
```

## Professional Workflow Management

The `src/workflow-manager.js` module introduces a system for defining and activating complex, multi-application workflows. It aims to provide users with perfectly arranged screen real estate tailored for specific tasks like professional coding, research, or teaching.

**Key Purposes**:
- Orchestrate the launching of necessary applications for a given workflow.
- Apply precise window layouts to ensure an optimal, non-overlapping arrangement of all application windows.
- Offer a structured way to define and manage these productivity-enhancing setups.

**Layout Strategy**:
The `ProfessionalWorkflowManager` primarily leverages the `DisplayPlacerIntegration` module to generate dynamic AppleScript for window layouts. This allows for pixel-perfect positioning based on the current display configuration. For workflows where such dynamic generation is not (yet) defined or for simpler setups, it can fall back to using traditional Moom named layouts.

**Defining Workflows**:
Workflows are defined within the `ProfessionalWorkflowManager.defineWorkflows()` method. Each workflow is an object specifying its properties. Here's an example of the 'coding' workflow:

```javascript
{
  // ... other workflows
  coding: {
    name: "Professional Coding Workflow",
    description: "Optimized layout for software development with zero overlaps",
    layout: "Professional Non-Overlapping Coding", // Maps to displayPlacer.createCodingLayout()
    applications: ["Visual Studio Code", "Safari", "iTerm", "Claude"],
    requirements: {
      minScreenWidth: 1920,
      preferredDisplays: 2,
      snapToGrid: true // This is a conceptual property for now
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

- **`name`**: A human-readable name for the workflow.
- **`description`**: A brief explanation of the workflow's purpose.
- **`layout`**: A string that determines the window arrangement.
    - If it matches a name like "Professional Non-Overlapping Coding" or "Ultimate Multi-Monitor Non-Overlapping", the `ProfessionalWorkflowManager` will call a corresponding method in `DisplayPlacerIntegration` (e.g., `createCodingLayout()`) to generate a dynamic AppleScript.
    - Otherwise, it can be the name of a pre-existing Moom named layout (e.g., "Teaching (Mac Mini)").
- **`applications`**: An array of application names that should be launched (if not already running) as part of the workflow.
- **`requirements`**: An object specifying any environmental prerequisites, such as minimum screen width or preferred number of displays. (Currently used for validation).

**`src/fixed-layouts.js`**:
This file (`src/fixed-layouts.js`, though not directly used by `ProfessionalWorkflowManager` at runtime yet) serves as a repository for examples of static, non-overlapping window layout configurations. It can be useful for testing `DisplayPlacerIntegration` methods or as a reference for creating new dynamic layout functions.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `src/workflow-manager.js` script also includes a command-line interface for local testing and interaction with the defined workflows. This allows users to list available workflows and activate them directly from the terminal.

**Running the CLI**:
To use the CLI, navigate to the project root and run:
```bash
node src/workflow-manager.js <command> [options]
```

**Available Commands**:

*   **`list`**
    *   **Description**: Lists all predefined professional workflows with their details, including ID, name, description, layout strategy, and applications.
    *   **Example**:
        ```bash
        node src/workflow-manager.js list
        ```

*   **`activate <workflowId>`**
    *   **Description**: Activates the specified workflow by its ID (e.g., 'coding', 'research'). This process involves launching the defined applications (if not already running) and then applying the configured window layout (either dynamically generated AppleScript or a Moom named layout).
    *   **Example**:
        ```bash
        node src/workflow-manager.js activate coding
        ```
    *   **Output**: The command will output the success status of the activation, any messages returned from the layout application process (e.g., from the executed AppleScript), and the results of the layout validation step.

**Note on Moom Server**:
The CLI currently uses an internal mock Moom server (`mockMoomServer` within `src/workflow-manager.js`). This mock server simulates interactions with Moom and AppleScript execution, allowing for testing of the workflow logic (application launching, layout selection, script generation, result parsing) without making live calls to the Moom application or executing actual AppleScript directly from the CLI. The full system, for instance, when the MCP server is run via `src/index.js` and invoked by Claude, interacts with the actual Moom application and executes AppleScript.

## Development

### Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test          # Basic tests
npm run test-ui   # UI automation tests
npm run validate  # Validate configuration
```

### Debugging

1. Check if Moom is running:
   ```bash
   pgrep -x Moom
   ```

2. Verify accessibility permissions are granted
3. Run the validation script:
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Error accessing Moom menu"
- Ensure Moom is running
- Verify accessibility permissions for Terminal and Claude Desktop
- Check that Moom's menu bar icon is visible

### Layouts not activating
- Layout names are case-sensitive
- Verify the exact layout name in Moom preferences
- Special characters in layout names may need escaping

### MCP not loading in Claude
- Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
- Check the config file path is absolute
- Verify Node.js is in your PATH
